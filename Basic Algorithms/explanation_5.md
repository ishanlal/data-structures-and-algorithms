Autocomplete with Tries:

Test cases: Please see attached Trie PDF.

Time Complexity: The time to insert and find words in a Trie would be the length of the word times the number of words. So, BigO = O(m*n), where m = length of word & n = number of words.

Space Complexity: We need to store all characters at-least once in the Trie. So, BigO = O(m*n), where m = number of words & n = length of word.
