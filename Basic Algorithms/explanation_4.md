Dutch National Flag:

Test cases: Arrays filled with 0, 1, 2 were provided.

Time Complexity: No sorting algorithm was used. A single traversal through the input array was done. Pointers were used to swap 0, 1 and 2. So, BigO = O(n).

Space Complexity: No recursion takes places. No new arrays are created, input array is modified in place. So, BigO = O(1).
