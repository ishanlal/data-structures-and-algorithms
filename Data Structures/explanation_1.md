LRU cache

Test case 1: Gets calls are made on values in Cache

Test case 2: A get call is made on a value not in cache

Test case 3: LRU Cache feature is tested, LRU value is moved out of cache and a get call on it returns -1.

Time Complexity: Ordered Dictionary was used to get BigO = O(1).

Space Complexity: Space complexity in the given problem is restricted to 5 values so BigO = O(1).
