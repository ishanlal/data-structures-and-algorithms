Blockchain

Test case 1: A block chain with different strings

Test case 2: A block chain with empty strings

Test case 3: A block chain with no data or None.

Time Complexity: Traverse the blockchain and append a new node to the end of the chain, so, BigO = O(n); n=number of items added to chain.

Space Complexity: The number of blocks you add keeps increasing the memory utilized by the chain so BigO=O(n)
