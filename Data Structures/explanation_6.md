Union Intersection

Test case 1: Elements for union and intersection

Test case 2: No elements for intersection

Test case 3: No elements for intersection

Time Complexity: For union we need to traverse the elements so BigO = O(m+n). For intersection the dictionary makes lookups O(1).

Space Complexity: Using the dictionary to store values so BigO = O(m+n).
